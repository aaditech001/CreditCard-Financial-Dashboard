# CreditCard-Financial-Dashboard
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard developed using SQL-cleaned credit card and customer transaction data.
The dashboard analyzes customer demographics, spending behavior, card usage patterns, and revenue performance to identify key drivers of financial growth.

🔧 **Tech Stack**
SQL – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling
Power BI – Dashboard design, DAX calculations, and visualizations
CSV Datasets – Customer and credit card transaction data

**Business Problem Addressed**
~ Credit card companies face challenges in understanding:
~ Which customer segments generate the most revenue
~ How customer age, job type, and education impact spending
~ Which card categories (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum) are most profitable
